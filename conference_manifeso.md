#Conference Manifeso

This conference will focus on iOS mobile applications. The aim is to provide hands on, end to end testing.
This means the talks will be selected in order to cover as much parts of any app as possible, from the initial AppDelegate start, to Networking, Database, Controllers, UI.
The objective is provide a good start for not seasoned engineer and more insight on a specific topic for expert engineers.
The format will be conference, but we'll ask the speakers to provide all code related and step by step example on a github repo that you will be able to follow and get deep on.
The objective is to get a mix between a workshop and a conference, and be highly technical. Also we'll have a couple of "less technical" conferences to valance the full day.

As attendee you also are pledged to follow the Inclusivity Manifesto.
