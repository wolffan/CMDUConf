Given the problems with Codes of conduct with Inclusivity manifesto won't be enough. Here's a formal one:

Social interaction is hard, and conferences bring so many different types of people together. We have as much to learn from each other as from the speakers. If we want to bring people together and help them understand each other, everyone must be safe and welcome.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code before and throughout the event.

CMDUConference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, Sexual images in public spaces, Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following, Harassing photography or recording, Sustained disruption of talks or other events, Inappropriate physical contact, Unwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior,

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately Exhibitors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff, including volunteers, should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Reporting harassment
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organizers immediately either in person, or by sending email to hello@cmduconf.com

Staff will be there to help anyone in case of harassment.
