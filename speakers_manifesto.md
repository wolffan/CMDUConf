#Speaker's Manifesto

As a speaker you are pledged to read and agree to the Code of Conduct and Conference Manifesto and/or to add amendments to improve it if you want.


You'll be asked to share the code and slides of the conference with the attendees (we'll provide a github account). We also encourage to use an Open Source medium complex project, to help picture any technique in an un-simple scenario. In this matter if you (your company) has a project already you're more than welcome to use it!

You're also pledged to have fun :-).
